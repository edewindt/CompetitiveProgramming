# Complexities:

* **O(1)/Constant:**
    * Mathematical formulas that just calculate an answer.
    * Unordered Set/Map lookup, insertion and deletion.
    * Singular Operations
    * Instantiation
    * Binary Search (Best Case)

* **O(Log(N))/Logrithmic:**
    * Binary Search (Worst Case)

* **O(N)/Linear:**
    * Linear Search
    * A for-loop
    * Bubble Sort (Best Case)

* **O(N(Log(N)))/Log Linear:**
    * Merge Sort
    
* **O(N^2)/Quadratic:**
    * Bubble Sort (Worst Case)
    * A nested for-loop
