# Algorithms

* **Brute Force (Complete Search):** This algorithm works by attempting all possible solutions. This is one of the simplest solutions, but also the one of the slowest, and grows at a rate of O(nm). N being the size of input, and M being the number of possible solutions. Therefore Time Complexity is O(nm). Space Complexity stays porpotional to the input size being O(n) in most cases.
