# Bit Manipulation

## Bitwise Operators

*When two values are compared, they are compared at the binary level and each of their bits goes through the process of evaluating to either a 0 or 1.*

* **Binary AND &:** When two bits are 1, then the result from the & operator will be 1, if two bits are anything else, than the result will be 0. 
* **Binary OR |:** When two bits are 0, then the result from the | operator will be 0, if two bits are anything else, than the result will be 1.
* **Binary XOR ^:** If both bits are the same, the result is 0, otherwise if both bits are different, the result is 1.
* **Binary Not ~:** Flips the value of all bits to be the opposite. 1 will result in 0, and 0 will result in 1.
* **Binary Left Shift <<:** Shifts the bits of the first operand LEFT by as many places as the second operand (this adds bits). This essntially is the same as multiplying by 2 to the power of the second operand.
* **Binary Right Shift >>:** Shifts the bits of the first operand RIGHT by as many places as the second operand (this subtracts bits). This essentially is the same as dividing by 2 to the power of the second operand.
